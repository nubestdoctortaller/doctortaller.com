      <p>
        When people talk about height growth, they often focus on genetics,
        numbers, or fixed limits. <strong>Doctortaller.com</strong> approaches
        the topic differently — by helping readers visualize how growth works
        as a long-term process influenced by lifestyle and overall health.
      </p>

      <p class="highlight">
        Think of height growth as a journey, not a shortcut.
